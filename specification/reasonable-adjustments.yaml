  title: Reasonable Adjustments API
  description: |
    ## Overview
    Use this API to access and update the [Reasonable Adjustment Flag](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/reasonable-adjustment-flag#top) on the [NHS Spine](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/spine). 

    The flag indicates the need for services to be adjusted to meet the needs of patients with learning, physical or sensory disabilities, autism or other significant impairments such as dementia – as defined in the [Equality Act (2010)](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2010/15/contents). A reasonable adjustment can mean alterations to buildings, such as providing lifts, wide doors, ramps and tactile signage. It may also mean changes to policies, procedures and staff training to ensure that services work equally well for people with physical or sensory disabilities, learning disabilities or long-term conditions such as dementia.

    Other adjustments include longer appointments, providing easy read materials or communications via a carer. This legal duty is anticipatory, which means a service should know about a person’s need for adjustments when they are referred or present for care.

    This API is a key enabler to NHS Digital’s requirement to adhere to one of the 9 digital milestones within the [NHS Long Term Plan](https://www.longtermplan.nhs.uk/online-version/chapter-3-further-progress-on-care-quality-and-outcomes/a-strong-start-in-life-for-children-and-young-people/learning-disability-and-autism/), which states:

    ** "By 2023/24, a ‘digital flag’ in the patient record will ensure staff know a patient has a learning disability or autism”. **

    Using this API, you can:
    - create, read, update amd remove the **Reasonable Adjustment Flag**, which stores the relevant details for the patient 
    - create, read, update and remove **impairments**, which enable clinicians to understand the range of adjustments the patient may require. **Note** the patient may decline to say what their impairments are
    - create, read, update and remove **adjustments** which are needed by the patient when providing their care
    - capture, view or update details of **consent** to record [Reasonable Adjustment Flag](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/reasonable-adjustment-flag#top) information and and how this was obtained. Consent may have been given by the patient or via a 'best interest decision' under the [Mental Capacity Act](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/social-care-and-support-guide/making-decisions-for-someone-else/mental-capacity-act/). In some cases consent can also be obtained from a lasting power of attorney for health and welfare or a court appoointed deputy. 

    The presence of a flag is intended to be visible to all staff who have access to the patient record.  The contents of the flag may only be visible to clinical staff - as determined by Role Based Access Controls.

    To find out more about how the flag works, categories and types of adjustments and the recording of impairments see [How the Reasonable Adjustment Flag works](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/reasonable-adjustment-flag#how-the-reasonable-adjustment-flag-works).

    To watch a video of a Reasonable Adjustment Flag being created in [SCRa](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/summary-care-record-application) see [Creating a Reasonable Adjustment Flag on the NHS Spine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dX-IwYXXEwE). 

    This API can only be accessed by relevant health and care staff providing direct care, authenticated with an NHS smartcard or equivalent.

    ## Legal Use
    This API can only be used where there is a legal basis to do so. Make sure you have a valid use case before you go too far with your development. You must do this before you can go live (see ‘Onboarding’ below).

    ## Related APIs
    To use this API, you will need the patient's NHS number, which can be retrieved by using the following API:

      - [Personal Demographics Service (FHIR) API](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/api-catalogue/personal-demographics-service-fhir) - use this API to search for patients and retrieve their details.  This API can also be used to update their details in some cases. This is the latest version of the PDS API and is recommended for all new integrators.

     When using this API, we also recommend that you consider using these related APIs:

      - [Female Genital Mutilation Information Sharing System (FGM-IS)](https://developer.nhs.uk/apis/fgm-v2.1/) - use this API to store and share FGM information of children under 18 with relevant NHS healthcare professionals across departments, organisations and geographical boundaries within England.

      - [Child Protection Information Sharing (CP-IS) - HL7 V3 API](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/child-protection-information-sharing-project/cp-is-domain-message-specification) - use this messaging and interactions guide to provide access to CP-IS, a sharing system which provides healthcare workers with access to recent unscheduled care attendance information for children under a local authority social care plan. 

      - [National Record Locator (NRL) (FHIR) API](https://developer.nhs.uk/apis/nrl/) - use this API to locate and share patient records held within local health and social care systems.

    ## API Status and Roadmap
     This API is in [alpha](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/reference-guide#api-status) - expect further breaking changes.
     
     The API is currently available for sandbox testing, but not integration testing or for production use.
         
    To see our roadmap, or to suggest, comment or vote on features for this API, see our [interactive product backlog](https://nhs-digital-api-management.featureupvote.com/?order=popular&filter=all&tag=reasonable-adjustment-flag#controls).

    If you have any other queries, please [contact us](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/help-and-support).

    ## Technology
    This API is [RESTful](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/api-technologies-at-nhs-digital#basic-rest-apis). 

    It also conforms to the [FHIR (STU3)](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/STU3/) global standard for health care data exchange.

    You don’t need to know much about FHIR to use this API - FHIR APIs are just RESTful APIs that follow specific rules. In particular:
    - array names are singular, for example `line` not `lines` for address lines
    - data items that are country-specific and thus not included in the FHIR global base resources are usually wrapped in an `extension` object

    ### Resources
    For information on the resources used within the Reasonable Adjustment Flag see [Reasonable Adjustment Flag FHIR specification](https://dev-reasonable-adjust-beta.netlify.app/explore.html).


    ## Network Access
    This API is available on the internet and, indirectly, on the [Health and Social Care Network (HSCN)](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/health-and-social-care-network). To use this API with NHS smartcards (see below) you do need an HSCN connection, although internet-facing alternatives are available.

    For more details see [Network access for APIs](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/network-access-for-apis).

    ## Authorisation
    This API is [user-restricted](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/security-and-authorisation#user-restricted-apis), meaning an end user must be present and authenticated to use it.

    The end user must be:
    - a healthcare professional
    - strongly authenticated, using either an NHS smartcard or a modern alternative available via [NHS Identity](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/nhs-identity)

    The API uses OAuth 2.0 to authorise the calling system. It supports the following security patterns:

    - [user-restricted RESTful API - using NHS Identity - combined authentication and authorisation](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/security-and-authorisation/user-restricted-restful-apis-nhs-identity-combined-authentication-and-authorisation)
    - [user-restricted RESTful API - using NHS Identity - separate authentication and authorisation](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/security-and-authorisation/user-restricted-restful-apis-nhs-identity-separate-authentication-and-authorisation)

    For more details, see [user-restricted APIs](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/security-and-authorisation#user-restricted-apis).

    ### Sandbox testing
    Our [sandbox environment](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/testing#sandbox-testing):
      - is for early developer testing
      - only covers a limited set of scenarios
      - is stateless, so it does not actually persist any updates
      - is open access, so does not allow you to test authorisation

      For more details on sandbox testing, or to try out the sandbox using our \"Try this API\" feature, see the documentation for each endpoint.

    ## Onboarding
    You need to get your software approved by us before it can go live with this API. We call this onboarding. The onboarding process can sometimes be quite long, so it’s worth planning well ahead.

    We will provide further details about how to onboard onto the API in December 2020.

This will describe the adjustment that the patient needs and will either be a coded national adjustment as defined by [SNOMED CT](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/terminology-and-classifications/snomed-ct), or an adjustment which has been manually keyed by a clinician. You can also use this endpoint to delete an existing adjustment. To find out more about the different types of adjustments see [How the Reasonable Adjustment Flag work](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/reasonable-adjustment-flag#how-the-reasonable-adjustment-flag-works).

        ## Overview
        Use this endpoint to record details regarding the patient's consent to share a [Reasonable Adjustment Flag](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/reasonable-adjustment-flag) record, as well as how this was obtained. Consent may have been given by the patient or via a 'best interest decision' under the [Mental Capacity Act (2005)](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/social-care-and-support-guide/making-decisions-for-someone-else/mental-capacity-act/). In some cases consent can also be obtained from a lasting power of attorney for health and welfare, or a court appointed deputy. Consent is usually obtained by a suitable member of staff discussing the [Reasonable Adjustment Flag](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/reasonable-adjustment-flag) with the patient, their carer or the approriate patient representative. The member of staff will then record the type of consent captured, along with some free text details providing more information about who provided the consent.

        ## Overview
        Use this endpoint to read details regarding the patient's consent to share a [Reasonable Adjustment Flag](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/reasonable-adjustment-flag) record, as well as how this was obtained. Consent may have been given by the patient or via a 'best interest decision' under the [Mental Capacity Act (2005)](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/social-care-and-support-guide/making-decisions-for-someone-else/mental-capacity-act/). In some cases consent can also be obtained from a lasting power of attorney for health and welfare, or a court appointed deputy. Consent is usually obtained by a suitable member of staff discussing the [Reasonable Adjustment Flag](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/reasonable-adjustment-flag) with the patient, their carer or the approriate patient representative. The member of staff will then record the type of consent captured, along with some free text details providing more information about who provided the consent.

      summary: Remove Reasonable Adjustment Flag Record
      description: |
        ## Overview
        Use this endpoint to remove a [Reasonable Adjustment Flag](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/reasonable-adjustment-flag) from the [NHS Spine](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/spine).  To remove a flag you must provide a reason for it being removed, for example the flag may have been created in error, or the flag may no longer apply to the patient. 

        For a patient it is represented as [CodeSystem-RARecord-RemovalReason-1](https://fhir.nhs.uk/STU3/CodeSystem/CodeSystem-RARecord-RemovalReason-1). This triggers the system to inactivate all Reasonable Adjustment Flag resources contained within the patient record.

        An identifier should be created when making a request, this will assist with any problems that may occur and should be included when an issue is raised with the helpdesk.
        It should ideally be a unique value to make message tracing easier and we would advise that there are no `"."` characters, but these are not enforced.
        This will be mirrored back in the response headers.
